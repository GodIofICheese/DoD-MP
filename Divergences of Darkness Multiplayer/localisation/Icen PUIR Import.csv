cattle_trucks;Cattle Trucks;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
cattle_trucks_desc;The introduction of automobiles has also had one ancillary benefit: the development of cattle trucks, large enough to hold multiple cattle at once and speed up the process of delivering livestock for slaughter.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
cattle_breeding_program;Cattle Breeding Program;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
cattle_breeding_program_desc;New methods of breeding livestock have led to a boom in cattle and horse populations, and permitted the average rancher far more control over the quality of his stock.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
accelerated_vulcanization;Accelerated Vulcanization;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
accelerated_vulcanization_desc;It was discovered in the early Twentieth Century that the addition of the organic compound aniline produced an accelerating effect. The active zinc salts in the aniline react strongly with the zinc oxide present in sulfur-vulcanized rubber to decrease the cure time necessary. Other compounds were later used that provided even faster cure times.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
silk_waste_spinning;Silk Waste Spinning;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
silk_waste_spinning_desc;This was a cumulative set of processes developed throughout the 19th century to process previously unusable silk. Sources of waste silk included the gummy silk fibres left over the predominant Silk Throwing Process and from the cocoons of the mulberry worms themselves. Previously this 'waste silk' had accounted for nearly 50% of raw silk production, and now it could be utilized too.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
inclosure;Inclosure;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
inclosure_desc;Inclosure is the process which was used in order to end some traditional rights, such as mowing meadows for hay, or grazing livestock on land which is owned by another person. Under inclosure, such land is fenced and deeded or entitled to one or more owners. By the 19th century, unenclosed commons had become largely restricted to rough pasture in mountainous areas and in relatively small parts of the lowlands.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
regenerative_forestry;Regenerative Forestry;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
regenerative_forestry_desc;New methods of harvesting our nation's forests must be undertaken, in order to ensure that these resources remain sustainable as techniques for harvesting lumber become more advanced.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
spinning_jenny;Spinning Jenny;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
spinning_jenny_desc;The spinning jenny is a multi-tool spinning frame. The device reduced the amount of work needed to produce yarn, with a worker able to work eight or more spools at once. It advanced the efficiency of the textile industry a great deal, and was one of the driving forces behind the Industrial Revolution in many textile-based countries.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,

mechanised_plantations;Mechanized Plantations;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
mechanised_plantations_desc;The introduction of mechanization to plantations allowed for harvesting to occur more rapidly, and for far more land to be manageable by the individual farmer. This freed up a great deal of labor, and led to the growth of urban centers.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
traction_engines;Traction Engines;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
traction_engines_desc;The traction engine is a self-propelled steam engine. Developed in the mid-nineteenth century, they were slow, heavy, and not very manouverable. However, they provided a clear revolution in road haulage of agricultural and forest products, replacing draught animals as the primary movers. Traction engines also could be used to provide a localized power source, and smaller versions were later produced that could plough fields without sinking into the soil.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
industrial_farming;Industrial Farming;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
industrial_farming_desc;The notion of a farm being the province of a single family or landowner is slowly becoming a thing of the past. The production of food is an industry, and the cost of farm machinery simply beyond the means of many. Large businesses are stepping in, creating industrial farms that are more akin to factories than anything else.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
industrial_livestock_husbandry;Industrial Livestock Husbandry;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
industrial_livestock_husbandry_desc;The old ways of ranching and livestock raising have become inadequate to supply the growing population. Large businesses are stepping in, creating large-scale operations that are more akin to factories than anything else.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
tree_plantations;Tree Plantations;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
tree_plantations_desc;The development of plantations specifically created for tree harvesting reduced the reliance on naturally-occurring forests for exploitation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,

modern_armaments_industry_desc;The modern armaments industry saw impressive gains in arms production.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
interruptor_gears;Interruptor Gears;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
interruptor_gears_desc;These were inventions which enabled machine guns to be mounted in front of the cockpit of the airplane to give it real combat power for the first time. One type of gear synchronized the firing of the guns with the spinning arc of the propellers to prevent them being shot off. The second or true interruptor gear developed with bombers prevented the guns from firing if any part of the plane would take a hit.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
medium_tanks;Medium Tanks;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
medium_tanks_desc;The Medium tank was developed in the interwar period to correct the design deficiencies and lack of speed of the early heavy tanks and the mobile yet underarmoured and outgunned light tanks. Medium tanks featured a main gun of between 37 and 76 millimetres to give it a more than adequate punch. At the same time, they were built with 360 degree revolving turrets and usually armed with at least one machine gun to provide defence from infantry attacks. They were built to specific designs with thicker armour than light tanks and with a lower profile, increasing their ability to survive on the battlefield.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,

bituminous_coal_for_coking;Bituminous Coal for Coking;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
bituminous_coal_for_coking_desc;Bituminous coal is a soft form of coal, usually appearing black or dark brown with bright and dark streaks running through deposits. A sedimentary rock formed by compression of peat materials, Bituminous Coal became favoured for use as coking coal in iron and steel production.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
deep_shaft_mining;Deep Shaft Mining;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
deep_shaft_mining_desc;Improvements in lighting, transport, and air circulation technology in the latter half of the 19th century allowed shaft mines to reach deeper into the earth than ever before. This permitted a great extraction of mineral resources from the veins in which they were found.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
motor_housing_insulation;Motor Housing Insulation;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
motor_housing_insulation_desc;Early electric motors were prone to sparking. This made the use of electric tools and machinery unsafe for underground mining due to the greatly increased possiblity of starting underground fires and explosions. American mining engineer Henry Beecher Dierdorff invented insulation that could be tightly wrapped around the housing of the electric motor to prevent sparks. This allowed for the safe use of electric cutting tools in the mines for the first time.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
modern_mine_hoists;Modern Mine Hoists;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
modern_mine_hoists_desc;These are hoists with cables and framing made from steel. Powered by electric winding engines, they could raise and lower greater loads from mining shafts. Mines could operate faster and deeper than before, while the electric engine enabled rapid stoppage and reversing of the hoist.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
conveyor_belt;Conveyor Belt;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
conveyor_belt_desc;The conveyor belt consisted of two pulleys with a continuous loop of material, powered by a motor transmission. The engineering firm Sandvik of Sweden was producing steel conveyor belts by 1891. Thomas Robins developed a conveyor belt that replaced expensive steel with rubber. In 1905, Thomas Sutcliffe patented the first conveyor belt for use underground. The conveyor belt made it easy to transport ores out of the mines, and was soon adopted by Henry Ford in his new assembly line factories.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
pneumatic_drill;Pneumatic Drill;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
pneumatic_drill_desc;The pneumatic drill is a mechanical drill driven by compressed air. Reciprocating pistons drive the compressed air upwards and down, propelling the drill bit into a surface and then drawing it out again. Pneumatic tools became preferred in the construction and operation of mining shafts and tunnels. Earlier tools had required steam power, and steam power required fire which was too dangerous due to the risk of igniting flammable gases underground. Larger pneumatic drilling machines utilized an external air compressor which could also help to ventilate the underground mines.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
steam_shovel;Steam Shovel;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
steam_shovel_desc;The steam shovel was the first powered excavating machine. Willia Otis patented an original design in 1839. Early steam shovels were 'partial-swing,' meaning the boom and winch could not rotate a full 360 degrees. Steam shovels became more widespread in the last half of the nineteenth century with the development of steel cables and a full-swing design. Steam shovels operated on railways until the invention of caterpillar tracks, and were heavily involved in the development of large-scale,open-pit mining. 102 steam shovels were employed to excavate the Panama Canal.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
mine_cutting_machines;Mine Cutting Machines;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
mine_cutting_machines_desc;The introduction of electricity to mining at the turn of the century permitted the development of new machines that could cut into or along mineral seams. These machines facilitated the extraction of resources by miners. Cutting machines later became sophisticated enough to displace much of the extraction work itself, formerly done by hand mining.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,

mechanized_sawmills;Mechanized Sawmills;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
mechanized_sawmills_desc;The introduction of steam power to the operations of sawmills allowed for a greater level of mechanization. Mills could be located far from water with the addition of rail connections. Mechanized Sawmills saw greater efficiency as the scrap waste from lumber production could be used to fuel the boilers. Increased factory costs came with the gains in efficiency however.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
diode;Diodes;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
diode_desc;In electronics, a diode is a two-terminal electronic component with asymmetric transfer characteristic, with low (ideally zero) resistance to current flow in one direction, and high (ideally infinite) resistance in the other. Diodes were the first semiconductor electronic devices.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
triode;Triodes;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
triode_desc;A triode is an electronic amplification device having three active electrodes. The term most commonly applies to a vacuum tube (or valve in British English) with three elements: the filament or cathode, the grid, and the plate or anode. The triode vacuum tube was the first electronic amplification device, which propelled the electronics age forward,  by enabling amplified radio technology and long-distance telephony.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
tetrode;Tetrodes;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
tetrode_desc;A tetrode is an electronic device having four active electrodes. The term most commonly applies to a two-grid vacuum tube. It has the three electrodes of a triode and an additional screen grid which significantly changes its behaviour.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
crystal_radio;Crystal Radio;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
crystal_radio_desc;A crystal radio receiver, also called a crystal set or cat's whisker receiver, is a very simple radio receiver, popular in the early days of radio. It needs no battery or power source and runs on the power received from radio waves by a long wire antenna. It gets its name from its most important component, known as a crystal detector, originally made with a piece of crystalline mineral such as galena.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
valve_radio_sets;Valve Radio Sets;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
valve_radio_sets_desc;With the discovery that triode valves could amplify signals it was soon noticed that they would also oscillate, a fact that was exploited in generating signals. Once the triode was established as an amplifier it made a tremendous difference to radio receiver performance as it allowed the incoming signals to be amplified. This gave significant improvements in the levels of gain that could be achieved, greatly increasing selectivity, enabling this type of receiver to outperform all other types of the era.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
carbon_transmitter;Carbon Transmitter;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
carbon_transmitter_desc;Before the proliferation of vacuum tube amplifiers in the 1920s, carbon transmitters were the only practical means of obtaining high-level audio signals, and were widely used in telephone systems. Their low cost," inherently high output and ""peaked"" frequency response characteristic were well suited for this application", and their use in new telephone installations continued up to the 1980s, long after they had been replaced by other types of microphones in other applications.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
candlestick_telephone;Candlestick Telephone;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
candlestick_telephone_desc;The candlestick telephone is a style of telephone that was common from the late 1890s to the 1930s. Also known as a desk stand, upright, or a stick phone, it came with or without a rotary dial, and with a ringer box.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
bullough_n_kenworthys_lancashire_loom;Bullough and Kenworthy's Lancashire Loom;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
bullough_n_kenworthys_lancashire_loom_desc;The Lancashire Loom was invented in 1842 by James Bullough and William Kenworthy. It was a culmination of several advances made to the Roberts Power Loom from 1830, it was a semi-automatic loom with a single-stop action for changing shuttles. It incorporated an improved automatic filling process and better temples to smooth the edges of the fabric. A Lancashire Loom could increased the productivity of a weaver by a factor of twelve times compared to an existing Cartwright Loom.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
machine_made_steel_cans;Machine-Made Steel Cans;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
machine_made_steel_cans_desc;A cumulative process of inventions and improvements have enabled canning factories to mechanize the production of cans and replace the tinned wrought-iron used with cheap steel. These new cans were smaller and could be produced in greater quantities to meet a growing demand.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
double_seams;Double Seams;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
double_seams_desc;Double Seams were invented in 1888 by Max Ams. A double seam uses advanced metal rolling techniques to create a double-edged seal between the rolled tin plate lids and the body of the can. Double Seaming provided an air-tight lid to keep micro-organisms out. It also removed the need to use solder as a sealant, thus making steel cans cheaper and faster to produce.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
lombard_and_holts_continuous_track;Lombard and Holt's Continuous Track;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
lombard_and_holts_continuous_track_desc;Alvin Lombard patented an effective continuous track system in 1901. This method of vehicle propulsion consisted of an interlocking band of hardened metal plates rotating around two or more wheels. Benjamin Holt acquired the patent in 1905 and began mass production. Holt later trademarked his system as "Caterpillar Tracks" after soldiers likened it to the movements of a caterpillar. Holt's track system was one of the key elements in the development of construction equipment and tanks.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
mercerization;Mercerization;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
mercerization_desc;Mercerization is a chemical process developed by Englishman John Mercer in 1844. He developed a chemical treatment for cotton using sodium hydroxide. Mercerization strengthened the fibres and made them easier to dye. H.A. Lowe modernized and popularized Mercer's treatment in the 1890s, producing cotton fabric with a lustrous appearance.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
rosendale_cement;Rosendale Cement;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
rosendale_cement_desc;Rosendale cement generally refers to a type of natural cement that was produced in and around Rosendale,New York from argillaceous limestone,but is a term that has had different definitions at different times. The fast-setting Rosendale natural cement mortars proved to be more efficient than the mortars based on lime and sand. Because of its reputation,"""Rosendale Cement"" has also been used as both a trade name and as a generic term referring to natural hydraulic cements produced elsewhere.;;;;;;;;;;;;x",,,,
vacuum_distillation;Vacuum Distillation;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
vacuum_distillation_desc;Vacuum distillation is a process for separating hydrocarbons using pressure. The liquid hydrocarbons are channeled into the lower portion of the distillation column at a temperature no greater than 370 degrees Celsius at an absolute pressure. The pressure in the column increases gradually from the top of the column to the bottom. The hydrocarbons evaporate and are piped out at various levels whenever the atmospheric pressure above the hydrocarbon to be distilled is lower than its vapor pressure. Vacuum distillation increases the relative volatility of the components, making the separation process quicker.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
fractional_distillation;Fractional Distillation;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
fractional_distillation_desc;Fractional Distillation is a process of separating crude oil into various fractions of hydrocarbons. The Crude Oil is heated to a temperature between 350 and 370 degrees Celsius which causes vaporization. The gas is then fed into a fractional distillation column, which is made up of several trays and outflowing channels. As the vapour rises, it cools according to its boiling point. The fractions with high boiling points condense into the lower trays; those with lower boiling points condense in the upper trays.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
fluid_catalytic_cracking;Fluid Catalytic Cracking;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
fluid_catalytic_cracking_desc;Fluid Catalytic Cracking is the most significant of the refining processes. It converts the high-boiling components of heavy crude oils into low-boiling, high-octane components such as gasoline and aviation fuels.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
bergius_process;Bergius Process;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
bergius_process_desc;The Bergius Process is a chemical process developed by German chemist Friedrich Bergius in 1913. The Bergius Process diectly converts coal to useful synthetic fuels. Once finely ground, the coal is dried by the addition of hot gas. Heavy oil is recycled from the process and added to the mixture. A catalyst may also be introduced to trigger or speed up the conversion reaction. Bergius received the Nobel Prize in 1931 for his work in high pressure chemistry.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
fischer_tropsch_process;Fischer-Tropsch Process;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
fischer_tropsch_process_desc;The Fischer Tropsh Process was developed at the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut für Kohlenforschung in 1925 by German chemists Franz Fischer and Hans Tropsch. The Fischer-Tropsch Process indirectly produces synthetic oils and fuels via a series of reactions. Coal or Natural Gas is converted to a gaseous state, and then reacts with a mixture of Carbon Monoxide and Hydrogen to produce various hydrocarbon products. Nazi Germany used this process extensively in the Second World War to convert their abundant coal stocks into replacement fuels after they were cut off from most natural sources of oil.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
synthetic_cement;Synthetic Cement;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
synthetic_cement_desc;'Natural' cement,namely cement that does not use chemical processes to make the result more durable,began to fall out of use with the production of modern concrete. A veriety of synthetic brands has developed and has resulted in a burgeoning construction industry.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,

salvo_firing;Salvo Firing;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
salvo_firing_desc;To judge the range of an enemy ship and calculate a firing solution, our ships now use "salvo firing": they fire a salvo of three to five shells, wait to see the splashes, and adjust accordingly. Once we know we have the enemy ship 'straddled' we open fire with all guns.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ap_capped_shell;Armour Piercing Shell;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ap_capped_shell_desc;We now use carefully-designed armour-piercing shells, with a cemented steel point and a high-explosive filling. This is more effective against modern armour.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
aero_ap_shell;Aerodynamic Armour Piercing Capped Shell;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
aero_ap_shell_desc;Research shows that putting a cap of soft metal over the point of an armour-piercing shell makes it more effective. However, this makes the shell less aerodynamic. So on top of that cap we now put another light steel cap to preserve the aerodynamics of the shell. This all means our battleships have unprecedented armour-piercing power at very long ranges.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
steam_auxiliaries;Steam Auxiliaries;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
steam_auxiliaries_desc;The first steam ships in the navies of the 19th Century were not warships but tugs, dredgers and despatch ships. By freeing sailing ships from constraints of tide and wind, these auxiliary ships make our fleets faster and more flexible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
triple_expansion_engine;Triple-Expansion Steam Engine;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
triple_expansion_engine_desc;A Triple-Expansion Steam Engine divides the work of expanding the charge of steam by feeding it through three cylinders of increasing diameter.
